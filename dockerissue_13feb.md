    1. Getting the following error when running docker setup from command
    prompt.
</p>
<p>
    2. This error information was not present in the getting started guide.
</p>
<p>
    Command provided at the command prompt was:
</p>
<p>
    docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
</p>
<p>
    <img
        width="601"
        height="338"
        src="file:///C:/Users/vidab/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.jpg"
    />
</p>
<p>
    3. Docker Subscription Service Agreement window was not displayed. May be
    mine is not a paid subscription. So I could not verify this screen exists
    or not.
</p>
<p>
    4. While running the sample program, lot of commands are there like
</p>
<p>
    docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started
</p>
<p>
    We should show in a window the output of these commands to know if the user
    is running them successfully then the output window contents should be
    similar.
</p>
<p>
    5. I was not able to run the sample application, tried multiple times using
    github, docker and visual studio code also.
</p>
<p>
    6. I have created a GitHub repository and sharing my GitHub repository
    details with you. It is created as a public repository so you can view it.
